# EECS 6322 Course Project

By Niki Mahmoudi and Kevin Y. H. Hui

Attempt to reproduce ["Adversarial Neuron Pruning Purifies Backdoored Deep Models"](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=4cEapqXfP30) by Dongxian Wu and Yisen Wang \
Paper originally presented in [NeurIPS 2021](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/poster/27055)

The paper further utilizes ["BadNets: Evaluating Backdooring Attacks on Deep Neural Networks"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8685687)

Current to do tasks:
- Finish the code creating and setting up ResNet18 (done)
- Explore adversarial attack patterns mentioned in paper
- - Attempt to train a first try model with adversarial attacks
